# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files for the extension:

- `icon16.png` (16x16 pixels)
- `icon48.png` (48x48 pixels)
- `icon128.png` (128x128 pixels)

## How to Create Icons

You can create these icons using any image editing software like Photoshop, GIMP, or online tools like Canva.

### Suggested Design

For the YouTube Smart Transcript extension, consider using:

1. A design that combines a YouTube play button with a transcript or text document
2. Red and white colors to match YouTube's branding
3. A simple, recognizable design that works well at small sizes

## Placeholder Icons

Until you create custom icons, you can use placeholder icons:

1. Visit [Material Design Icons](https://material.io/resources/icons/)
2. Search for icons like "subtitles", "text", or "description"
3. Download in the required sizes
4. Rename the files to match the required filenames

## Icon Requirements

- All icons should be in PNG format
- The background should be transparent
- The design should be recognizable even at the smallest size (16x16)
- Follow Chrome's [extension icon guidelines](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/manifest/icons/)
